                    <p class="ar-text-justify"><strong>72H (-15%)</strong> is one of our turnaround time options which means that your job will be delivered within 72 hours from the time you submit the order. If you select <em>72H (-15%)</em> option, we will give you a discount of <strong>15%</strong> and we will deduct this amount from the total value of the order itself.</p>

                    <p class="lead-14 font-bold p-t-md">What is this 15% discount for?</p>
                    <p class="ar-text-justify">Our Regular Turnaround Time is <strong>48 Hours</strong>. If you don't really need these images done and back within 24 Hours or 48 Hours, you can select <strong>72 Hours</strong> option and you will be given with a 15% Discount. We give you this discount because we get more time to process your images.</p>
